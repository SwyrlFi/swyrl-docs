# Audits & Design

## Swyrl Architecture

Swyrl is built on Ramses V3 Core, which is based on Uniswap V3, with several enhancements. These improvements include [dynamic system and protocol fee mechanisms](/core-mechanics/s33#fees) and [s33](/core-mechanics/s33). Ramses V3 Core also introduces a new accounting system to track how much active liquidity each concentrated liquidity position provides.

### Pools will **ALWAYS** remain immutable, and permissionless.

There is no actor in the entire system that could modify liquidity in the pools unless explicitly approved to do on the contracts. The protocol, nor even the timelock, have the ability to modify the liquidity pools. This stands true for both Concentrated Liquidity (V3) and Legacy Liquidity (V2/Stableswap)

### Access Control

There are 3 distinct access control roles in the AccessHub system.

`DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, MULTISIG + TIMELOCK have this role initially, then only TIMELOCK

`PROTOCOL_OPERATOR`, As the name states, this role is for protocol operators. The main functionality the protocol operator role has is surrounding Governance enabling/disabling. Protocol operators can call: `killGauge`, `reviveGauge`, `governanceWhitelist`, and other similar commands.

`SWAP_FEE_SETTER` Also self-explanatory, this role sets swap fees on liquidity pairs. The protocol's dynamic fee algorithm utilizes this role for consistent value accrual. The function used is `setSwapFees`
