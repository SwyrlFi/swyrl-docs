## MEV Solutions

| Solution | Status | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| S33 AMO | **COMING SOON** | Arbitrages the redeem floor and gives back to voters ensuring all value is kept inside the protocol instead of going to outside arbitragers. |
| Backrun Arbitrage | **COMING SOON** | Frontruns every arbitrage and returns value to users, protecting LPers from LVR and adverse costs from toxic MEV bots. |

## Automated Market Operations (AMO)

Swyrl's AMO system is designed to optimize protocol efficiency and maximize value for all participants through systematic arbitrage when the S33 redeem floor triggers.

| Performance | Distribution |
|-------------|--------------|
| **$0** captured so far | **100% of proceeds distributed to voters** |

The AMO system executes a systematic arbitrage process:

1. Target liquidity pool identification
2. Fee privilege utilization for optimal execution
3. SWYRL → S33 conversion
4. S33 → xSWYRL redemption
5. Instant exit: xSWYRL → SWYRL
6. Profit distribution to S33

| Revenue Stream | Allocation |
|----------------|------------|
| Instant Exit Proceeds | 50% → Voter rebase |
| Arbitrage Earnings | 100% → S33 compounding |

Market inefficiencies are captured by the AMO bot, ensuring value stays within SWYRL through systematic arbitrage and optimal execution.

## Stopping Exploitative Liquidity on Swyrl

### What Is Exploitative Liquidity?

Some liquidity providers (LPs) exploit decentralized exchanges (DEXs) by adding **tight, one-tick liquidity positions** to maximize token rewards, which are streamed per second to in-range liquidity. Using mempool access, they withdraw liquidity when a large swap is detected, avoiding **impermanent loss** while claiming rewards without supporting trades.

#### How It Works

- **Tight Position**: LPs add liquidity in a narrow, one-tick range to earn maximum rewards per unit of capital.
- **Mempool Watch**: They monitor the mempool for incoming swaps that could shift prices and cause losses.
- **Quick Exit**: Before the swap hits, they remove liquidity, dodging impermanent loss.
- **Reward Grab**: They still collect rewards for the brief time their liquidity was active.

This undermines genuine LPs who maintain stable liquidity and bear market risks.

---

### Why DEXs Are Vulnerable

DEXs often fall prey to this exploit because:

- **Instant Reward Streaming**: Rewards are paid per second and don't have proper mechanisms which require sustained liquidity.
- **No Holding Period**: LPs can withdraw instantly, avoiding losses from swaps.

Swyrl tackles these issues head-on with targeted solutions.
