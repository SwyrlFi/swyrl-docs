# MEV Module

## Overview

Swyrl integrates generalized execution abstraction protocols to redistribute MEV value back to protocol participants, ensuring there is no value leak to outside extractors, bringing capital efficiency to the next level.

## Understanding MEV in DeFi

**MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)** refers to the additional profit that can be extracted by reordering, inserting, or censoring transactions within a block.  
In traditional AMMs, external actors such as searchers and block builders often capture this value through techniques like:

- **Sandwich Attacks:** Surrounding user transactions to profit from predictable price movement.  
- **Frontrunning:** Inserting transactions before high-impact trades to profit from slippage.  
- **Backrunning:** Executing immediately after large swaps to capture post-trade arbitrage.

These practices **reduce user returns** and **increase slippage**, effectively siphoning value out of the ecosystem.

## MEV Solutions

Swyrl embedded Fastlane’s Atlas Router into its trading interface, allowing users to toggle and execute MEV-protected trades. 

This integration ensures transactions are routed in a way that minimizes the risk of frontrunning, sandwich attacks, and other forms of value extraction, securing better execution and protecting user capital.

## Technical Flow

1. User initiates a swap on the Swyrl DEX interface.  
2. The Atlas Router evaluates multiple route candidates using off-chain simulation.  
3. It selects the optimal route that maximizes user outcome while preventing MEV exploitation.  
4. The trade is bundled and broadcasted through a protected relay to prevent transaction reordering.  
5. Execution results in secured pricing and a net MEV redistribution inside Swyrl.

## Future Extensions

Swyrl’s MEV Module is designed with modular extensibility, paving the way for:

- **Multi-Router Integration:** Expanding beyond the current Atlas Router by integrating additional MEV-aware routing protocols to optimize execution paths across diverse liquidity and infrastructure providers.
- **Native Mempool Integration:** Establishing direct, low-latency access to Monad’s mempool for real-time orderflow visibility, enabling proactive mitigation of frontrunning and sandwich risks.

As Monad’s execution environment matures, Swyrl will continuously enhance its routing layer, combining multiple protection systems and native mempool intelligence to deliver the most efficient, transparent, and aligned trading experience on the network.
