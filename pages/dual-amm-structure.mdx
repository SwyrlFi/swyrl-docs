# Dual AMM Structure

Swyrl employs a **dual AMM structure** that supports both **stable pools** and **volatile pools** for liquidity provisioning. This means liquidity providers (LPs) can choose the pool type best suited for their asset pair. Swyrl also incorporates **concentrated liquidity provision**, enabling liquidity providers to deploy capital more efficiently and achieve deeper market liquidity.

***

### Stable Pools

Designed for asset pairs that trade around a **stable price parity** (e.g. two stablecoins or synthetically pegged assets). These pools use a **curve formula optimized for minimal slippage** when assets have equal or near-equal value.

#### Benefits:

* **Extremely low slippage**
* **Efficient pricing**
* **Liquidity concentrated around the peg**

Traders swapping between like-kind assets in stable pools enjoy a smoother and more cost-effective experience.

***

### Volatile Pools

Meant for asset pairs with **independent, freely moving prices** (e.g. $SWYRL and $MON, or any two distinct tokens). These pools use the traditional **constant product formula** (`x * y = k`), similar to **Uniswap V2**, which is more suitable for volatile price swings.

#### Benefits:

* **Supports uncorrelated assets**
* **Robust liquidity across wide price ranges**
* **Simple and proven model for volatile markets**

### Unified Platform for All Trading Needs

By combining **stable and volatile AMMs**, Swyrl covers the **full spectrum of trading** on a single platform.

An **automated smart order routing system** directs trades through the most optimal path:

* **Stable-to-stable**: Uses a stable pool directly.
* **Unrelated tokens**: May route through intermediate pools (e.g. via a stablecoin bridge or common trading pair).

This smart routing guarantees that traders **always get the best price** available across Swyrlâ€™s liquidity network.

### Concentrated Liquidity Provisioning

Swyrl also integrates **concentrated liquidity provisioning** (inspired by **Uniswap v3**) into its pool designs.

LPs can **concentrate their liquidity into specific price ranges** rather than across the entire curve.

#### Advantages for LPs:

* **More efficient capital usage**
* **Higher fee earnings**
* **Deeper effective liquidity with fewer tokens**

By focusing liquidity where most trading occurs, LPs help:

* **Increase capital efficiency**
* **Provide greater market depth**
* **Enable tighter spreads for traders**

This means Swyrl can facilitate **large trades with low slippage**, **without requiring enormous liquidity** across all price ranges.
