## Before You Vote!

**Definition**

**Epoch:** A unit of geologic time that is a division of a period. We use the term epoch as a indicator when all votes and rewards are reset for the following week, starting a fresh week of new incentives.

For Swyrl this period of time is 7 days always restarting at **00:00 Thursday UTC time**.

**Vote Timing**

Most users wait until the final minutes before an epoch ends to vote for pools with the highest rewards (APR). This is so you can see the final vote dilution of each pool before voting for incentives.
