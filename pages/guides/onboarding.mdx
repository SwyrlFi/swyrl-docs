# Onboarding

## On-Ramp/Off-Ramp

When starting out in crypto you'll need tokens to fund your journey! The best way to engage in the DeFi markets is by using **FIAT (e.g. USD)** and creating an account on a centralized exchange. What exchange you use is ultimately up to you and your current country of operations. Here is a short list of common Centralized Exchanges used to On-Ramp and Off-Ramp Fiat to Crypto:

- Binance
- Coinbase
- Crypto.com
- Gate.io
- MEXC

### Pick a Crypto Wallet

Using Swyrl's website requires a Crypto-Currency **"wallet".** As the name references, it's a personal interface to interact with all of your digital assets, tokens, or even art (NFTs!).

There is a large selection of wallets that a user can pick from but here is a short list of trusted, popular & compatible ones you can choose from:

- [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet)
- [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/)
- [Rabby Wallet](https://rabby.io/)
- [MetaMask Wallet](https://metamask.io/)

## Putting it all together

Assuming you have now installed a Wallet & have Tokens on your central exchange account, you can now transfer your tokens to your wallet! Each transaction made on the blockchain requires **GAS**. Each chain utilizing DeFi smart contracts *usually* consist of a different gas token. Swyrl is deployed on the Monad chain. In Swyrl's case, to create transactions from your Crypto Wallet you will need **MON** as the Gas Token. After purchasing the asset on the centralized exchange of your choosing, you can withdraw from your account to your wallet.

**Beware**

Every centralized exchange, and even tokens have different requirements for a deposit or withdrawal. Please ensure that you take time to study the information & guides of your given exchange to ensure you understand the process and are not at risk of losing your funds!
