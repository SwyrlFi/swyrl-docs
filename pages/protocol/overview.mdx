**Swyrl Protocol: A Monad-native trading center and concentrated liquidity marketplace.**

Swyrl Protocol is an innovative Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub integrating an advanced trading engine with robust governance-driven liquidity control.

It builds on the successful **ve(3,3)** model, introducing a unique twist called [**Liquid Governance**](../core-mechanics/liquid-governance). This model aligns traders, liquidity providers, and token holders in a synergistic DeFi ecosystem while preserving flexibility and openness.&#x20;

Swyrl’s dual AMM model blends both stable-swap and volatile-swap mechanisms into one platform, allowing users to trade efficiently whether assets have a fixed peg or freely floating price. On the governance side, Swyrl introduces the liquid governance framework – an evolution of ve(3,3) model – that removes rigid lock-ups and replaces them with a fluid, incentive-driven system​.
